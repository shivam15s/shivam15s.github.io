I am a Senior Undergraduate in Computer Science & Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Gandhinagar, India. 

My research interests lie in Machine Learning and Data Science. In particular, I like to design and analyze techniques to mine and model data. I also enjoy Competitive Programming as it arouses my curiosity for finding solutions to logical puzzles. Check out my [codeforces profile](https://codeforces.com/profile/let-me-handle).
<!-- A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge. -->
